### Background

[Elham](https://elham.sa) is one of the most prominent learning platforms in Saudi Arabia, serving millions of users each month. In addition to providing educational resources, Elham also hosts multiple government websites, making reliability, scalability, and security critical to their operations. With over 500 websites under their management, Elham required a hosting solution that could meet their complex and demanding needs.

### The Challenge

Before migrating to Stormkit, Elham was using a well-known alternative service provider. However, as their platform grew, they encountered significant bottlenecks, particularly in their deployment processes. The primary challenge was the concurrency limitation during deployments. With over 500 websites to manage, the deployment process could take up to 24+ hours, severely impacting their ability to update content and roll out new features quickly.

Additionally, Elham faced regulatory concerns due to new regulations in Saudi Arabia. These regulations necessitated greater control over their infrastructure and data localization requirements, which their previous hosting provider could not fully support.

Finally, Elham was grappling with high hosting costs and a lack of control over their infrastructure. They needed a more cost-effective solution that would allow them to manage their infrastructure more efficiently while complying with regulatory requirements.
