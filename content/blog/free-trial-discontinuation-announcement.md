We are announcing an important change to Stormkit's offerings: we will be discontinuing the free trial for our cloud solution, effective immediately.

## Why the Change?

At Stormkit, our mission is to provide robust, secure, and efficient hosting solutions. After careful consideration, we are shifting our focus to enhance our self-hosted version, where we believe the true value of Stormkit shines. The self-hosted option allows users to fully explore the product’s capabilities with a single license, offering greater control, customization, and security.

Additionally, maintaining a free cloud hosting tier has presented challenges, including the need to address malicious activities, such as phishing attacks, which compromise the safety and reliability of our platform. By prioritizing self-hosted solutions, we can better ensure a secure and high-quality experience for all users.

## What This Means for You

- **Existing Free Trial Users**: You will retain access to your current trial until its expiration. After that, we invite you to explore our self-hosted version or contact our team for guidance on transitioning.

- **New Users**: The self-hosted version is now the primary way to experience Stormkit. With a single license, you can unlock the full potential of our platform in a secure, controlled environment tailored to your needs.

- **Paid Cloud Users**: Your subscriptions and services remain unaffected, and we’re committed to delivering the same high-quality experience.

## Why Self-Hosted?

The self-hosted version of Stormkit empowers you with:

- **Full Control**: Host on your infrastructure for maximum flexibility.
- **Enhanced Security**: Mitigate risks by managing your own environment.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Control the underlying infrastructure to optimize your costs.
- **Scalability**: Tailor resources to your specific requirements.

We deeply value your trust and support as we evolve Stormkit to better serve you. Thank you for being part of our journey.
