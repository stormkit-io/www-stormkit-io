Stormkit users now have more flexibility on what branches to deploy automatically. To use this new
feature, visit your application's page and click on **Edit configuration** on the environment that you would like to modify and find the **Auto Deploy Branches** field to instruct Stormkit for which branches
auto deployments are turned on. The field accepts a `regexp` pattern. Here are some examples:

```regex
^dependabot/.*             # Deploy only branches that start with dependabot/
^(?!dependabot|renovate).* # Deploy all branches that do not start with dependabot or renovate
release-*                  # Deploy all branches that start with release-
```

The logic to determine whether a branch should be automatically deployed or not is depicted
in the following diagram:

    <img src="/assets/blog/whats-new/auto-deployment-flow-transparent.svg" alt="Auto deployment flow" />
</div>

```

```bash
curl -XPOST https://api.stormkit.io/hooks/app/:app-id/deploy/:token/:environment-id \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    -d '{"publish": true|false, "branch": ":branch-name"}'
```
