## April 18th, 2022

We have removed the limit on the number of applications you can host on Stormkit based on your tier. It's
all unlimited now.

## April 17th, 2022

It is now possible to view usage data by visiting **App** > **Usage**.

## April 10th, 2022

Free users can now deploy up to 15 times per month.

## April 9th, 2022

Stormkit users now have more flexibility on what branches to deploy automatically. To use this new
feature, visit your application's page and click on **Edit configuration** on the environment that you would like to modify and find the **Auto Deploy Branches** field to instruct Stormkit for which branches
auto deployments are turned on. The field accepts a `regexp` pattern. Here are some examples:

```
^dependabot/.*             # Deploy only branches that start with dependabot/
^(?!dependabot|renovate).* # Deploy all branches that do not start with dependabot or renovate
release-*                  # Deploy all branches that start with release-
```

The logic to determine whether a branch should be automatically deployed or not is depicted
in the following diagram:

### Other changes

- `Commit prefix` configuration option located in the application's settings page is removed
- Providing `--skip-deploy` in a commit message is no longer considered

## April 1st, 2022

It is now possible to overwrite default environment configuration while
using Hooks API to trigger a deployment.

The Hooks API supports both `GET` and `POST` methods.

```
curl -XGET https://api.stormkit.io/hooks/app/:app-id/deploy/:token/:environment-id?publish=true|false&branch=:branch-name
```

```
curl -XPOST https://api.stormkit.io/hooks/app/:app-id/deploy/:token/:environment-id \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    -d '{"publish": true|false, "branch": ":branch-name"}'
```

You can turn on the deploy triggers from your application's settings page.
