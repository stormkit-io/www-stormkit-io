# Deploy Your Project with Stormkit

By incorporating our "Deploy" button into your repository's markdown, you can easily facilitate the cloning of your GitHub repository and its subsequent deployment on Stormkit. This functionality only works with **Github's template repositories** offering a user-friendly deployment process.


i.e for

<section>

https://github.com/stormkit-io/monorepo-template-react

Markdown looks something like following


```bash
[![Deploy with Stormkit](https://www.stormkit.io/button.svg)](https://api.stormkit.io/deploy?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fstormkit-io%2Fmonorepo-template-react)
```

</section>
