# Deployment Status Checks

Status checks allow you to automatically verify conditions after a successful deployment. Based on the results, you can choose to either publish the deployment or delay it, depending on the checksâ€™ outcome.

## Configuring Status Checks

To set up status checks:

1. Navigate to **Environment Config** > **Deployment Settings** > **Status Checks**.
2. Click **Add Status Check**.
3. Enter the command to be executed for the status check.
4. (Optional) Provide a name and description for the check to give context to other developers.
5. Click **Save** to apply the status check.

The command will execute with the same environment variables available during the build process.

For an example of a status check script, visit our [sample repository](https://github.com/stormkit-io/sample-project/blob/main/scripts/e2e.ts).

## Modifying an Existing Status Check

To modify an existing status check:

1. Navigate to **Environment Config** > **Deployment Settings** > **Status Checks**.
2. Click the menu button ( **...** ) next to the status check you want to modify.
3. Update the necessary fields, such as the command, name, or description.
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

This will update the status check for future deployments.

By using status checks, you ensure that only deployments meeting your predefined conditions will be published, adding an additional layer of control and reliability to your CI/CD pipeline.
