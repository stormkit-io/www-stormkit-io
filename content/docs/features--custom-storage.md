# Custom Storage

At Stormkit, we are committed to providing our users with a flexible platform that empowers them to make the best choices for their application deployments. We understand the importance of avoiding vendor lock-in and giving users the freedom to choose their preferred Content Delivery Network (CDN) provider. With our latest feature, you can easily deploy your applications to different CDN providers, such as Bunny CDN and Amazon S3, while maintaining the promise of a vendor lock-in-free experience.
