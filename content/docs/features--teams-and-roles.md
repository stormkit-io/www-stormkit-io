# Teams and Roles

Create teams to collaborate with your colleagues.

## Create a team

A `Personal` team is created by default for each member. This space is to allow users manage their personal projects.

If you'd like to collaborate with other team members, you'll have create a new team. You can do so by
clicking on the `Team Toggle` on the upper left part of the screen and click on `Create Team`.

</div>

Give your team a name and click on `Create`.
