Stormkit integrates perfectly with your git flow. After your application is set, all you need to do to deploy is just to git push. To setup your application, sign in or sign up from <a href="https://app.stormkit.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app.stormkit.io</a>. You can authenticate using your <a href="https://gitlab.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitbucket</a> account.
