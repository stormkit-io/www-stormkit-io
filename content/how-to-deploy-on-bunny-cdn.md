title: How to deploy to BunnyCDN
---

We're happy to announce BunnyCDN integration on Stormkit üéâ  This feature allows Stormkit users to deploy their applications to BunnyCDN Storage Zones and use them as a hosting service for static applications.

### Benefits

Stormkit specializes in providing an optimal developer experience to build and preview application whereas BunnyCDN is a lightning fast CDN with features such as DDoS protection and image optimization. This integration allows users to benefit from both worlds and have a powerful developer experience while keeping the bandwidth costs lower compared to other services.
 
### Steps 

1. On **BunnyCDN** create a Storage Zone and obtain the API key - make sure to take the one with write access
1. On **BunnyCDN** create a pull zone, connect it to the Storage Zone and obtain the endpoint
1. On **Stormkit** visit your application
1. Click on **...** next to the environment you'd like to connect - each environment needs it's own pull zone
1. Click on **Custom Storage** from the dropdown
1. Fill the form and click **Submit**

### Deploy your application

Anytime you will deploy your application and have the **publish** feature turned on, your application will be deployed to BunnyCDN. 

Please keep in mind that as of today, publishing existing deployments will not update the BunnyCDN storage. This feature will be added soon.

### Working with larger teams

If your team consists of more developers, it is advised to create an environment and a storage/pull zone for each developer in the team. Since each deployment will overwrite existing files in the storage, this will allow developers preview their changes directly on BunnyCDN without affecting others deployments. Here's an example:

``` bash
$ git co -b my-test-branch
# make some changes
$ git add . && git commit -m "chore: update files" && git push -u origin HEAD
# open a merge request on Gitlab and either:
# 1. type "@stormkit-io deploy <my-environment-name> --publish
# 2. deploy manually from the UI with your environment configuration and publish setting turned on
```

That's it! Hope you enjoyed it üôèüèª
