        With Angular projects, you'll need to modify the app slightly and
        prepare it for Serverless environments. Since in the serverless
        environments we don't have a concept of long-lived process, we'll need
        to tell Angular not to listen to any port but rather directly export the
        app.

      <pre><code>{{angularServerTs}}</code></pre>
      <h3>webpack.server.config.js</h3>
      <pre><code>{{angularWebpack}}</code></pre>
      <p>
        Instead of using the <code>PUBLIC_URL</code> you can also tell Stormkit
        to load specific files from the CDN. Here is an example but more
        information can be found under
