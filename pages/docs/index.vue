    <section>
      <p>
        There are several reasons why you would need like a tool like Stormkit:
      </p>
      <h3>1. Improve developer experience</h3>
      <p>
        Developer experience matters. The more developers are happy from their
        workflow, the more productive they will be. Stormkit strives to
        perfectionize the deployment and application management workflow.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Focus on your application</h3>
      <p>
        For the reason mentioned above developers tend to spend a lot of time on
        improving their workflow. Stormkit allows you to focus on your
        application rather than spending time on your infrastructure.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Added value</h3>
      <p>
        Stormkit offers very valuable features to Frontend developers, such as,
        <nuxt-link to="/docs/features/staged-rollouts"
          >Staged Rollouts</nuxt-link
        >,
        <nuxt-link to="/docs/features/remote-config">Remote Config</nuxt-link>
        and <nuxt-link to="/docs/features/snippets">Snippets</nuxt-link>. Again,
        building these features for your workflow is possible however very time
        consuming.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Performance</h3>
      <p>
        It's our job to provide a powerful infrastructure that is highly
        scalable, performant and secure.

      <p>
        If you are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Spending a lot of time maintaining your frontend application's
          infrastructure
        </li>
        <li>
          Looking for an affordable way to scale your application
        </li>
        <li>
          Looking for a way to deliver as fast as possible
        </li>
        <li>
          In need of features like Staged Rollouts, Remote Configuration,
          Snippet Injections and so on
        </li>
        <li>
          Building a JAMStack or a Node.js server side rendered application
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a Headless CMS like
          <a href="https://www.storyblok.com/" rel="StoryBlok">StoryBlok</a> and
          you're looking for compatible hosting solutions
        </li>
      </ol>
      Then you may want to use Stormkit. If you're using server side
      technologies other than Node.js such as Wordpress, Drupal or Magento then
      Stormkit is not suitable for you.
