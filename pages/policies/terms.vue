    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <h3>Last Updated: May 12th, 2020</h3>
    <p>
      Stormkit ("Stormkit," "we," "us," or "our") welcomes you. Thank you for
      choosing to access and use our service (the "Service") made available to
      you through our website located at
      <nuxt-link to="/">https://www.stormkit.io</nuxt-link> (the "Website"),
      <nuxt-link to="https://app.stormkit.io"
        >https://app.stormkit.io</nuxt-link
      >
      (the "App", or the "Platform") or our other subdomains.
    </p>
    <p>
      We provide access to and use of our Service subject to the following terms
      of service (the "Terms of Service"), which are effective as of the date
      stated above. By using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read,
      understood, and agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of
      these Terms of Service and the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy,
      which is hereby incorporated by reference. Please take the time to review
      our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to any terms in these Terms of
      Service or the Privacy Policy, then please do not use our Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may change these Terms of Service from time to time, and will post any
      changes on the Website or notify you via email, at our option, as soon as
      such changes are in effect. If you are using the Service on a free trial
      basis, then by continuing to use the Service after we make any such
      changes to the Terms of Service, you are deemed to have accepted such
      changes. If you have purchased a Service subscription, then the changes
      will not go into effect until your Service subscription renews. Please
      refer back to these Terms of Service on a regular basis.
    </p>
    <h3>Access and Use</h3>
    <p>
      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Stormkit will
      provide access to and use of the Service to you or the entity which you
      have authority to bind to this Agreement ("Subscriber"). We will also
      provide access to and use of the Service to any employee of Subscriber or
      other individual authorized by Subscriber (each, an "Authorized User").
      Subscriber acknowledges that each Authorized User must agree to these
      Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy prior to use and that Subscriber
      shall be responsible for ensuring compliance by each Authorized User with
      these Terms of Service and for any breach of these Terms of Service by any
      Authorized User.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may only use the Service to store, retrieve, query, serve, and execute
      Your Content that is owned, licensed or lawfully obtained by you. As used
      in these Service Terms, (a) “Your Content” includes any “Company Content”
      and any “Customer Content”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subscriber is solely responsible for any data or content uploaded or
      stored on the Service by Subscriber or any Authorized User ("Subscriber
      Data"). In no event shall Stormkit be responsible for the use or misuse of
      any Subscriber Data by Subscriber or any Authorized User or other third
      party. Subscriber warrants and represents that it either owns or has the
      right to provide all Subscriber Data. Subscriber hereby grants Stormkit a
      non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free license to use the Subscriber
      Data to provide the Service and as otherwise described in herein or in our
      Privacy Policy. As stated in the Privacy Policy, we take reasonable steps
      to protect the Subscriber Data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
      disclosure, alteration, or destruction. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
      event will we share the project information that you upload into the
      Service with third parties for marketing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      All right, title, and interest in and to the Service, the Website, the
      App, and any information, data, software, graphics, and interactive
      features contained therein, including all modifications, improvements,
      adaptations, enhancements, or translations made thereto, and all
      proprietary rights in any of the foregoing (collectively, "Stormkit
      Property"), shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of
      Stormkit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subscriber will not, and will not permit any Authorized User or other
      third party to: (i) allow anyone other than an Authorized User to access
      or use the Service; (ii) use the Service in any way that is not expressly
      permitted by this Agreement, including, without limitation, reverse
      engineering, modifying, copying, distributing, or sublicensing the
      Service, or introducing into the Service any software, virus, or code; or
      (iii) use the Service in violation of any applicable law or regulation.
    </p>
    <h3>Registration</h3>
    <p>
      Prior to using the Service, Subscriber will be required to register for an
      account. During the registration process, Subscriber will select logon
      credentials for each Authorized User. Logon credentials can only be used
      by the Authorized User to whom they are assigned and cannot be shared
      among Authorized Users or with third parties. Subscriber is solely
      responsible for the confidentiality and use of all logon credentials for
      its account and those assigned to Authorized Users, as well as for any use
      or misuse of the Service using Subscriber's or any Authorized User's logon
      credentials. Subscriber shall notify us immediately if it becomes aware of
      any loss, theft or unauthorized use of any logon credentials, and we
      reserve the right to delete or change them at any time and for any reason.
    </p>
    <h3>Fees and Payment</h3>
    <p>
      In consideration for the access to and use of the Service, you shall pay
      Stormkit the fees determined according to the payment plan that you have
      selected at registration. You must provide accurate information regarding
      your credit card or other payment instrument, and you must promptly update
      your payment information if such information changes. You hereby authorize
      Stormkit to periodically bill your payment instrument in advance, in
      accordance with the payment plan you have selected. If you wish to dispute
      any charges, you must provide notice to Stormkit of such dispute within
      sixty (60) days of payment of the disputed charge. All amounts paid are
      non-refundable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to change our prices at any point. If we do change
      prices, we will provide notice to you through the Website or via email, at
      our option, at least thirty (30) days before such change is to take
      effect. Your continued use of the Service after the price change
      constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount; provided, however,
      that if you have purchased an annual Service subscription, the price
      change will not go into effect until the end of your then-current
      subscription period.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may choose to bill through an invoice. If we so choose, all amounts due
      must be paid by the date specified in the invoice or access and use of the
      Service may be terminated. Unpaid invoices are subject to a finance charge
      of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by
      law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection. You shall be
      responsible for all taxes associated with the Service other than U.S.
      taxes based on Stormkit's net income.
    </p>
    <h3>Term and Termination</h3>
    <p>
      Stormkit may suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Service,
      in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason; provided, however,
      that if you have purchased a subscription for the Service, Stormkit’s
      right to suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Service will
      be limited to cases where you have failed to pay the applicable
      subscription fees or have otherwise breached these Terms of Service, and
      have not cured such payment failure or other breach within 10 business
      days of receiving written notice of such payment failure or other breach
      from Stormkit (and provided, further that Stormkit may suspend your access
      to and use of the Service immediately without notice in the event that
      Stormkit reasonably determines that your account may cause potential harm
      to Stormkit or third parties). You may terminate your account at any time
      upon notice to us; provided, however, that if you have purchased a
      subscription for the Service, your right to terminate your account before
      paying the full amount of fees for the subscription period that you have
      committed to will be limited to cases where Stormkit has breached these
      Terms of Service, and has not cured such breach within 10 business days of
      receiving written notice of such breach from you. In the event of
      suspension or termination (other than cases where Stormkit locks your
      account due to fraudulent activities or other potential harm to Stormkit
      or third parties), Stormkit will provide you with access to your
      Subscriber Data for at least 15 days following such termination. It is
      your responsibility to keep backup copies of the Subscriber Data.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we reasonably believe any of Your Content violates the law, infringes
      or misappropriates the rights of any third party or otherwise violates a
      material term of the Agreement (including the documentation or the Privacy
      Policy) (“Prohibited Content”), we will notify you of the Prohibited
      Content and may request that such content be removed from the Services or
      access to it be disabled. If you do not remove or disable access to the
      Prohibited Content within 2 business days of our notice, we may remove or
      disable access to the Prohibited Content or suspend the Services to the
      extent we are not able to remove or disable access to the Prohibited
      Content.
    </p>
    <h3>DISCLAIMERS; LIMITED WARRANTY</h3>
    <p>
      THE STORMIT PROPERTY IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," AND STORMIT
      DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SAME OR OTHERWISE IN
      CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL
      EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
      AVAILABILITY, ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION, AND ANY WARRANTIES
      ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF
      TRADE. TO THE EXTENT THAT Stormkit MAY NOT AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW
      DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY
      WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER SUCH LAW.
    </p>
    <h3>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
    <p>
      IN NO EVENT WILL STORMIIT BE LIABLE TO SUBSCRIBER OR ANY OTHER PARTY,
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AUTHORIZED USER, FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,
      INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY
      KIND (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST REVENUES OR PROFITS) ARISING
      FROM OR RELATING TO THE STORMKIT PROPERTY OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO THESE
      TERMS OF SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER STORMKIT WAS ADVISED, HAD OTHER
      REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF. STORMKIT'S
      AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES UNDER THESE TERMS OF SERVICE WILL
      NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY SUBSCRIBER HEREUNDER DURING THE SIX (6)
      MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
    </p>
    <h3>Indemnification</h3>
    <p>
      Subscriber will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Stormkit and its
      officers, directors, managers, and employees from any and all liabilities,
      costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
      fees) in connection with any third-party claim that any of the Subscriber
      Data: (i) infringes or misappropriates any third-party intellectual
      property rights, privacy or publicity rights, or any other rights; or (ii)
      violates any applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Stormkit shall
      promptly notify Subscriber of the claim, provided, however, that failure
      to provide such notice shall not relieve Subscriber of its indemnity
      obligations unless it is materially prejudiced thereby. Subscriber shall
      have control over the defense of the claim, provided that (i) Subscriber
      does not make any admission of liability on behalf of Stormkit or agree to
      any settlement that imposes a financial burden on Stormkit without
      Stormkit's prior written consent; and (ii) Stormkit shall have the right
      to participate in the defense of any such claim, at its own cost, with
      counsel of its choice.
    </p>
    <h3>General Provisions</h3>
    <p>
      Subscriber shall not assign these Terms of Service or any of its rights
      hereunder without the prior, written consent of Stormkit. Subject to the
      foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
      the Parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns. These Terms
      of Service and performance hereunder shall be construed and governed by
      the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to conflicts of
      laws principles. The parties consent and agree that any and all litigation
      between them arising from these Terms of Service or the business
      relationship created hereby shall take place in the state or federal
      courts located in New York, New York. Each Party irrevocably consents and
      submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such courts. If any provision
      of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall be
      amended or replaced in the way that best reflects the original intention
      of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms of Service shall remain
      in full force and effect. These Terms of Service, together with the
      Privacy Policy and any pricing information made known to you at
      registration, constitute the final and complete agreement between the
      parties regarding the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or
      contemporaneous communications, representations, or agreements between the
      parties, whether oral or written.
