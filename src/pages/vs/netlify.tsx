        <Typography>
          When it comes to hosting and deploying frontend applications, both{' '}
          <strong>Stormkit</strong> and <b>Netlify</b> are prominent platforms.
          While Netlify is well-known for its ease of use and cloud-based
          hosting, Stormkit stands out by offering self-hosting capabilities,
          giving developers more control over their infrastructure. In this
          guide, we'll compare the two platforms across key categories to help

            preview, enabling you to view and test changes in a separate
            environment before going live.

            Netlify is a fully managed platform, meaning you don't have direct

            beneficial as it allows them to focus solely on development without
            managing infrastructure. However, it also limits users who need more
            granular control over their environment.

            Netlify provides built-in security features, including automatic
