          Stormkit is an intuitive, scalable, and cost-effective self-hostable
          platform for frontend applications. It comes with built-in features

            One of the most significant differences between Stormkit and Vercel
            lies in the hosting approach:{' '}
            <strong>Stormkit is self-hostable</strong>. This means you have the
            option to deploy Stormkit on your own infrastructure, providing you
            with complete control over your environment. Whether you're looking
            to deploy on-premises or within your private cloud, Stormkit gives
            you flexibility in how and where your applications are hosted. This
            approach is ideal for enterprises with specific security or
            compliance requirements, allowing full control over data residency,
            networking, and scaling.

            worry about managing the underlying infrastructure; Vercel takes
            care of everything for you. This makes Vercel an excellent choice
            for developers who prioritize convenience and simplicity, allowing
            them to focus solely on coding and application performance without
            handling the complexities of server management.

            Stormkit shines when it comes to customizability. Because Stormkit
            is self-hostable, you have complete control over your deployments,

            complex use cases where fine-tuning is required, such as deploying
            applications in hybrid environments, or scaling based on your exact
            needs. Stormkit also integrates seamlessly with existing

            Vercel provides a more opinionated stack. While it is easy to use,

            Customizations such as scaling, server configurations, or special
            networking requirements might be limited, as Vercel abstracts much
            of the underlying infrastructure away from the user. It is designed
            for simplicity and speed but may not be the best fit for more
            complex or enterprise-level projects requiring a high degree of

            Vercel also offers a variety of pricing tiers, from free to

            can be additional costs as you scale up, particularly if your app
            requires advanced features, more bandwidth, or premium performance.
            While the free tier is generous, larger projects may find the

            Stormkit is designed with no vendor lock-in in mind. Because it is
            self-hostable, you can deploy it on your own infrastructure, switch
            hosting providers, or move to a completely different cloud with
            ease. This flexibility ensures that you aren't locked into a single

            Vercel is a managed service, which inherently comes with some level

            reworking your deployment pipeline and infrastructure.

            customizability. Its self-hostable nature makes it ideal for
            projects with specific infrastructure requirements, such as
